### Hi there 🖐️, I am belce1982 👹, also known as Victor Gonzalez :man:

### 🤔 About me:

I’ve been a professional developer for more than 10 years and I’ve been programming daily for about 20 years, and as Socrates said: ‘I know that I know nothing’ 😅😆

I have an insane drive to every single day become a better programmer, co-worker, friend, husband, father, person, etc. 😉

We are 🐍 what we repeatedly do, so, excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit 🐲
